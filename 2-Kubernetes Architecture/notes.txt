We cannot access cluster if master node not working

- Docker: Container run time engine

- Kube-API server: Entry point. user requests to access cluster, 
the requests goes to API server which authenticates and see which functions access does the user have.

- Kube- scheduler: it sees that the pod requirement can be achieved by which node and 
which node is healthy to deploy the pod on a particulat node

- Controller manager: Brain of kubernetes cluster. Maintains status of all the different things in cluster.

- ETCD databse: only kube-api server can directly connect to ETCD databse.
