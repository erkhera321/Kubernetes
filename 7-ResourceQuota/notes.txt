In any namespace if any user can create any resource with limitless cpu or memory or storage 
then it will icrease resource consumption a lot

- can limit number of pods in a namespace
- can limit cpu , memory

- if the cpu or memory consumption is more then even less pods can be made than the limit
e.g. if 4 pods are allowed but 3 pods consumed all the allocated memory and cpu then it cannot make the 4th pod

use file based approach to create resource quota
