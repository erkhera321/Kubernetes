Problem
- IP adress changes when a pod is deleted and recreated either on same node or on different node

solution- service: provides static IP

service gives a static IP which is used  by user to connect to it and then it connects to the application pods at backend

service distributes the traffic equally to pods and use lables and selectors

pods- lables
service-selector
